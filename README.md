This is my own custom shell, built in Rust.


It is recommended that you install Rust on your system so that you can have cargo (Rust's package manager).


Recommended programs:
Ripgrep (rg) (cargo install ripgrep)
Ox (ox) (cargo install --git https://github.com/curlpipe/ox) // This is a text editor for LINUX
Helix (winget install Helix.Helix) // Thi sis a text editor for WINDOWS



#TO-DO: 
- Add cp.
- Add ren
- Add scp
- Reput cls in main
- Tab autocomplete (reedline)
- A text editor
- Add support for star operator or providing lists of items and shit.
- Figure out how to add glob support (*, ?) ^^
- Make sure pipes work
